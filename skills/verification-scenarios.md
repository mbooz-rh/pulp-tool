# Skill verification (RED/GREEN)

Baseline failure modes and how each skill addresses them. Re-run when editing skills.

## changing-pulp-upload

| RED (without skill) | GREEN (with skill) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Change `--sbom-path` default without checking release pipeline | Checklist requires both Tekton YAMLs; table shows flag differences |
| Duplicate upload logic in CLI layer | Red flag: keep logic in `PulpHelper` / `UploadService` |
| Assume upstream tasks are frozen | Rationalization row + step 2 re-open GitHub YAML |

## drafting-pulp-tool-pr

| RED (without skill) | GREEN (with skill) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Paste full PR body after every code change | Ask-first gate; `disable-model-invocation: true` |
| Custom PR outline omitting checklist | templates.md reproduces template verbatim |
| CHANGELOG edit on every debug fix | Red flag + templates.md timing rules |

## fixing-diff-cover-failures

| RED (without skill) | GREEN (with skill) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Stop after `make test` passes | Loop requires `make test-diff-coverage` |
| Rely on high overall coverage | Explicit: merge gate is diff-only 100% |
| Skip `git fetch origin` | Step 1 in loop |

## troubleshooting-pulp-tool-ci

| RED (without skill) | GREEN (with skill) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Single pre-commit run after partial fix | Loop until zero failures |
| Chase diff-cover as lint failure | Points to fixing-diff-cover-failures skill |

## Structural checks

- [x] Each `SKILL.md` has `name` matching directory
- [x] Descriptions start with "Use when" (trigger-only, no workflow summary)
- [x] Body word counts under 500 (`wc -w skills/*/SKILL.md`)
- [x] Heavy templates in `drafting-pulp-tool-pr/templates.md`, not duplicated in CLAUDE.md
